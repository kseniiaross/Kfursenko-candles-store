      "KFursenko Candles began in New York with a simple ritual: a quiet evening, a clean flame, and a scent that makes a space feel like home. Kseniia Fursenko didn’t start with a factory plan — she started with a feeling. The kind you remember: soft light on the table, fresh air through a window, and a calm that stays with you.",

    title: "Craft, Not Noise",
    body:
      "Each candle is made in small batches, with careful attention to wax texture, wick placement, and the way a fragrance opens over time. We obsess over the details you can’t always see — because you can always feel them. Clean burn. Balanced throw. A scent that doesn’t shout, it invites.",

    title: "A Label You Can Feel",
    body:
      "Packaging is part of the experience. The first touch, the first look, the moment you place it on a shelf — it should feel intentional. Minimal, elegant, and quietly luxurious. Like a beautiful object that belongs in your space, not just a product you use and forget.",

    title: "Slow Luxury for Everyday Life",
    body:
      "We believe luxury can be simple: a clean design, a soft scent, and the comfort of a ritual you return to. Light it while you read, while you cook, while you reset your thoughts after a long day. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s presence.",

  {
    title: "Story",
    body:
      "Kseniia’s story is a blend of creativity and discipline: learning the craft, testing combinations, refining every step until it feels right. From New York apartments to bright worktables, the process stayed the same — careful, consistent, and deeply personal.",
